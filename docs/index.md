# Capture The Flag 101 ðŸš©

Welcome to **CTF101**, a site documenting the basics of playing Capture the Flags. This guide was written and maintained by the [OSIRIS Lab](https://osiris.cyber.nyu.edu/) at New York University in collaboration with [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/).

## Overview

Capture the Flags, or CTFs, are computer security competitions. 

Teams of competitors (or just individuals) are pitted against each other in various challenges across multiple security disciplines, competing to earn the most points.

CTFs are often the beginning of one's cyber security career due to their team building nature and competitive aspect. In addition, there isn't a lot of commitment required beyond a weekend. 


!!! info
    For information about ongoing CTFs, check out [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/).


In this handbook you'll learn the basicsâ„¢ behind the methodologies and techniques needed to succeed in Capture the Flag competitions.
